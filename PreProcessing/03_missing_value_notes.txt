8. Imputation Strategies for Missing Data
Review your handling of missing values. Check:
Distribution of missing values across columns and rows.
Imputation techniques used (e.g., mean, median, mode, or model-based).
Iterative, KNN imputer


9. Feature Engineering Opportunities
Identify new features or transformations that may improve your model.
Examples:
Polynomial features for numeric variables.
Encoding methods for categorical variables (e.g., one-hot encoding, target encoding).


11. Dimensionality Reduction
If you have a high-dimensional dataset, consider dimensionality reduction techniques such as:
PCA for numeric data.
Factor analysis for categorical data.

Use Stepwise VIF Reduction:
Sequentially remove variables with the highest VIF and recalculate until all VIFs are below the acceptable threshold (commonly 5).
