## üõ†Ô∏è Design Principles

- **Minimal magic**: Code-first approach with visible logic
- **Tutorial-style**: Key theory as collapsible notes, not distractions
- **Config-ready**: Structure encourages reusability across datasets and tasks
- **Business-minded**: Final cell outputs explain *what it means* ‚Äî not just *what it does*
